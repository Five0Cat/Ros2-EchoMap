[31mCMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:14 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findlocal_mapper.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project
  has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "local_mapper", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "local_mapper" with
  any of the following names:

    local_mapperConfig.cmake
    local_mapper-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "local_mapper" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "local_mapper_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "local_mapper" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it
  has been installed.
